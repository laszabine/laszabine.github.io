          A formal account of Dependent Case Theory
        </span>
        <div class="project-abstract">
          I develop a formal system based on variations of Minimalist Grammars (Stabler 1997) that can capture the observed generalizations.

          German impersonal passives
        </span>
        <div class="project-abstract">
          German has passives that retain accusative case and must receive a generic interpretation.
          I analyze them as impersonal actives.

        Turkish nominalized argument clauses as complex NPs.
      </span>
      <div class="project-abstract">
        I analyze clause-type triggered differential subject marking in Turkish by arguing that
        factive nominalized argument clauses are complex NPs with a silent head noun.
        This creates a nominal case-assignment domain, whereby the subject can receive genitive case.

        The real(is) distinction in <i>before</i>- and <i>after</i>-clauses.

      <div class="project-coauthors">
        (with Marcin Dadan, Kadir G&ouml;kg&ouml;z, Jayeon Park, Yongsuk Yoo)
      </div>
      <div class="project-abstract">
        We compare <i>before</i>- and <i>after</i>-clauses in German, French, Japanese, Polish, Korean, and Turkish.
        We provide a uniform analysis for the different morphological strategies these languages use to mark <i>before</i> clauses.
        We argue that the intra-language differences between <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> are due to different selectional properties for mood,
        which stems from realis vs. irrealis presuppositions.
