        Based on insights from mathematical linguistics, we argue that syntactic dependencies spanning independent subtrees, that is: not expressible via c-command relations, must be established by movement.

          A formal account of Dependent Case Theory
        </span>
        <div class="abstract">
          I formalize DCT into Minimalist Grammars (Stabler 1997) with MSO-constraints on derivation trees (Graf 2013),
          and I argue that a formalization based on licensing by covert movement is not possible as it increases the complexity class of natural language.
          I provide a formalism that allows to circumvent this problem (to suspend the SMC) without incurring this blow-up in complexity.

        We compare <i>before</i>- and <i>after</i>-clauses in German, French, Japanese, Polish, Korean, and Turkish.
        We provide a uniform analysis for the different morphological strategies these languages use to mark <i>before</i> clauses.
        We argue that the intra-language differences between <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> are due to different selectional properties for mood,
        which stems from realis vs. irrealis presuppositions.
